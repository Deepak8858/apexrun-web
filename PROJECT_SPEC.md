1\. Project Vision

ApexRun is a high-performance running platform that bridges the gap between Strava's social engine and Runna's AI coaching. This website serves as a technical showcase for my professional resume, emphasizing complex system architecture (Flutter + Go + PostGIS) and agentic AI integration (Gemini 1.5 Flash).



2\. Technical Stack (The Showcase)

Frontend React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for high-end animations).



Data Visualization Recharts (for mock runner performance graphs).



IconsAssets Lucide React for consistent technical iconography.



Hosting Target Vercel (Optimized for performance).



3\. Core Features to Highlight

AI Form Lab On-device computer vision tracking 33 pose landmarks at 30fps.



Agentic Recalibration Automated plan adjustments based on real-time biometric recovery (HRVSleep).



PostGIS Ingestion A high-concurrency Go backend processing thousands of GPS pings per second with spatial indexing.



4\. Required Website Sections

Section,Content Requirements

Hero,"Bold headline: ""The Agentic Running Partner."" Include a CTA to GitHub."

Architecture,A high-level diagram or list explaining the Flutter-Go-Supabase pipeline.

Feature Grid,"Visual cards for Form Analysis, Dynamic Coaching, and Live Segments."

Code Showcase,A syntax-highlighted block showing a sample PostGIS spatial query.

Resume Footer,"Links to LinkedIn and GitHub with a ""Download Resume"" button."5. Design Guidelines (ApexRun Design System)

Color Palette: #0A0A0A (Primary Background), #CCFF00 (Electric Lime - Action Color).



Typography: 'Inter' for body, 'Roboto Condensed' for data metrics to mimic the mobile app.



Vibe: "Performance Dark Mode"—high contrast, data-rich, and engineered for speed.



6\. Development Instructions for Claude Code

Read and Plan: Start by reading this file and planning the component architecture.



Implementation: Execute phase-by-phase (Header -> Hero -> Features -> Tech Section -> Footer).



Verification: Ensure all metrics in the feature cards are quantifiable (e.g., "98% GPS Accuracy," "<500ms AI Latency").
